# Fire Detection Using Computer Vision

This project is a part of the BBM416 course, conducted by the Computer Engineering Department of Hacettepe University. The main objective of this project is to detect fires using computer vision techniques.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Fire breakouts can be a major risk to public safety, especially in warm areas like the Mediterranean. Traditional fire detection methods can have limitations in terms of accuracy and speed. Therefore, early detection using computer vision techniques can be helpful to minimize the damage caused by fires.

## 💡 Dataset

We will be using the following datasets to train and test our fire detection model:

| Dataset Name | Description | Number of Images |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**FIRE Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phylake1337/fire-dataset) | Contains fire and non-fire images, including flames, smoke, and indoor/outdoor scenes. | 755 |
| [**Cyclone Wildfire Flood Earthquake Database**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/cyclone-wildfire-flood-earthquake-database) | Includes wildfire images for testing the model. | 152 |

## 🔍 Solution Strategy

To identify fires in the images, our suggested solution involves the usage of computer vision techniques like image classification and object detection.

- We will use the FIRE dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images as either fire or non-fire.
- We will also use this Cyclone-Wildfire-Flood-Earthquake Database to test our model against wildfire images.
